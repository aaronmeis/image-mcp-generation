Each dataset is labeled as \"Total Monthly Sales ($)\" to reflect that these bars denote total sales earned in each month rather than daily or weekly transactions and allows viewers of the chart a quick overview of your business's revenue trend across different times of the year, providing insights into which months were most successful.\n \nPlease replace `[15000, 20000, ...]` with actual sales data for each month to create an accurate representation suitable for decision-making and analysis within your business context.","latencyMs":4558,"model":"phi3:mini","promptVersion":"chat-v1"}
